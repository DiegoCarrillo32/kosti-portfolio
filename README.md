# Portfolio - Vibecoded with Antigravity 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a modern web application built with cutting-edge technologies and an AI-driven development workflow.

## 🤖 The AI-Driven Approach (Vibecoding)

This project was built using a **"Vibecoding"** philosophy—a collaborative process between human creativity and AI intelligence. By pair programming with **Antigravity** (powered by Google's Gemini), I was able to:

- **Accelerate Development**: Rapidly prototype components, refactor code, and implement complex features like internationalization and animations in record time.
- **Focus on Design & Logic**: Spend less time on boilerplate and more time refining the user experience, accessibility, and visual aesthetics.
- **Iterate Instantly**: Test ideas, fix bugs, and polish the UI through a seamless conversational interface.

The result is a portfolio that reflects my skills not just in coding, but in leveraging modern AI tools to build better software, faster.
